# Mindfulgram

> Use Instagram in a mindful way.

Mindfulgram is a browser extension that allows you to use Instagram in a mindful way, by removing the addictive content consuming aspects, and just leaving the useful aspects.

## Why?

Many of us have often found ourselves endlessly scrolling through apps, like zombies, at the mercy of addictive products. At this point, we are aware of what's going on. Apps are marketed as "free", yet consume our most valuable asset, our time. Think about how many hours you spend on these apps and websites, and multiply that by what 1 hour of your time is worth.

Obviously distractions are beyond just apps and websites, but Mindfulgram is here to help your Instagram usage. Instagram is a great tool, we love Instagram. However, it comes with addictive features. Mindfulgram takes out the toxic aspects, and leaves Instagram as the simple useful tool it was from the beginning.

## Features

### Hide Instagram suggested posts

We follow who we follow for a reason. Let's keep things simple and intentional. No more continuous scrolling on irrelevant posts.

### Hide Instagram explore page

The explore page is filled with content which is made to keep you stuck to your screen, like a zombie. If you really want to explore, you will go out and explore yourself.

### Hide Instagram reels

The reels page is pretty much just the explore page, but for reels, and for reals more addictive. It can led to those same endless scrolling sessions that has made TikTok so addictive.

### Hide Instagram stories

If something is worthy of being shared and consumed, it will end up as a post on our feed. Everything else is just extra. No offense.

### Hide Instagram comments

The Instagram comment section can be a toxic place, even if you are a positive person, negative energy can still have a subliminal negative affect. Let's clear it out.
