# Mindfulgram

<Logo />

Mindfulgram is a browser extension that allows you to use Instagram in a mindful way, by removing the addictive content consuming aspects, and just leaving the useful aspects.

## Why?

Many of us have often found ourselves endlessly scrolling through apps, like zombies, at the mercy of addictive products. At this point, we are aware of what's going on. Apps are marketed as "free", yet consume our most valuable asset, our time. Think about how many hours you spend on these apps and websites, and multiply that by what 1 hour of your time is worth.

Obviously self-sabotage is beyond just app usage, but Mindfulgram is here help. Instagram is a great tool, but with addictive aspects. Mindfulgram takes out the toxic aspects, and leaves Instagram to be a useful tool.

We love instagram. Let's just use it in a more mindful way.
